          When deciding how much house you can afford, one of the most important pieces to determine is whether a home will fit into your monthly budget. A mortgage calculator helps you understand the monthly cost of a home. And ours will allow you to enter different down payments and interest rates to help determine what is affordable for you.

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-md mb-4">
          Lenders determine how much you can afford on a monthly housing payment by calculating your 
          <a href="#" className="text-green-600 underline"> debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</a>. 
          The maximum DTI you can have in order to qualify for most mortgage loans is often between 45-50%, with your anticipated housing costs included.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-md">
          Your DTI is the balance between your income and your debt. It helps lenders understand how safe or risky it is for them to approve your loan. A DTI ratio represents how much of your gross monthly income is spoken for by creditors, and how much of it is left over to you as disposable income. Itâ€™s most commonly written as a percentage. For example, if you pay half your monthly income in debt payments, you would have a DTI of 50%.
